! You can also just use the batch file under tools !

create a file called "Submod_name_macros.hpp" in the Submod maindir, in there you have to define:

#define MODFOLDER pubsec //exchange "pubsec" for Submod folder name

#define MODSUFFIX police //exchange "police" for a clearly identifyable name for the submod, it is used as suffix for all assets

You can also just copy the file form "pubsec" and then exchange those two things


See "infos" folder for more infos about the format and the macros.
